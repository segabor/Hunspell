Hunspell
Ruby interface to hunspell spell checker

Copyright 2007, Gabor SEBESTYEN


WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

Hunspell is an easy native Ruby interface to the famous Hunspell spell checker
library which is part of OpenOffice and Mozilla products. With this bundle
you can start to develop your own AJAX based spell checker service for
Ruby on Rails.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Before install Hunspell be sure to have the following components:

- Ruby >= 1.8
- rubygems
- hunspell >= 1.2.x (libhunspell-1.2)
    http://hunspell.sourceforge.net
- dictionary files for Hunspell
    http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries


INSTALLATION
------------

The best way is to use gem package manager.

	gem install hunspell

If you want to build Hunspell from scratch grab the source and issue the
following commands:

	ruby extconf.rb && make


FreeBSD gotcha: hunspell spell checker package does not deploy its header
files. Run gem or ruby command with an extra option:

	gem install hunspell -- --with-include-dir=...

	or

	ruby extconf.rb --with-include-dir=... && make
	
Replace ... to the path pointing to hunspell includes.


FIRST STEPS
-----------

Here's a very simple example how to use Hunspell. Cut it and run in ruby.


=== example.rb ===

require "rubygems" # import gem package manager
gem "hunspell"     # load Hunspell module
require "Hunspell" # inject Hunspell class to Ruby namespace

# instantiate Hunspell with Hungarian affix and dictionary files
#
sp = Hunspell.new("hu.aff", "hu.dic") 

# spell check Hungarian word 'ablak' (window) => true
#
puts "Is 'ablak' correct? #{sp.spellcheck('ablak')}"

# get suggestions for mispelled word 'paprika'
#   => ["kaprica", "patrica", "paprika", "papcica",
#       "papráca", "papruca", "paprima", "paprikáz",
#       "paprikása", "paprikás", "Papradnó"
#      ]
#
puts "Suggestions for 'paprica': " + sp.suggest("paprica").inspect

=== end of example ===

Note: you might run this example with -Ke ruby option if you want to
see accented letters instead of backslash prefixed utf codes.
